# Natours-Udemy
Pure Sass/CSS website with responsive web design from Jonas Schmedtmann's advanced CSS course. 


# Project Overview

This project was designed to teach students the basics of SASS with SCSS in terms of: variables, mixins, nesting of classes and subclasses in the BEM class naming patterns.
More advanced CSS topics such as clip paths, linear gradients, creating manual CSS grids, REM and EM, as well as background blends were also covered in this project.
Finally, responsive web design was also touched upon and how to create media queries and how to convert desktop-first designed websites to work for smaller devices.
